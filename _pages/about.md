I am an incoming Master student in Artificial Intelligence & Robotics at [<u>Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University</u> ](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/)under the supervision of [<u>Prof. Huazhe Xu</u>](http://hxu.rocks/). 

Now, I am a senior student at [<u>School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation</u>](http://smea.hitsz.edu.cn/), [<u>Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)</u>](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/index.html). My major is Automation, with a minor in Computer Science and Technology.

My research interests mainly include reinforcement learning🖥️ and robotics🤖. I'm particularly interested in the integration of reinforcement learning algorithms with actual robotic hardware🦾. 

Apart from this, I am also particularly interested in medicine🩺 and electronic circuits🔌.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
